This is a simple script to allow for cloning of any type of hard drive, with an estimated progression bar and error checking.
 
What it does:
* Displays information about selected drives. 
* Prevents data overwriting by not allowing cloning to drive with information.
* Confirmation of cloning for no accidentale clones. 
* Requires you to run in root
